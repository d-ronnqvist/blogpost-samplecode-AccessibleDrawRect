===================================

# About
This is very small smaple project showing how to make custom drawings accessible to VoiceOver. Everything of interest is found in the `-drawRect:` implementation of the custom view class.

The purpose of this code is to show how all kinds of custom drawing: text, images and vector drawing _can_ be made accessible and that it isnâ€™t too hard.

# Blog post
